## 1. Executive Overview

Provides senior management with a high-level snapshot of financial health. Five KPI cards display **Total Revenue**, **Total Profit**, **Profit Margin**, **Revenue YTD** and **YoY Revenue Growth**. Two line charts below track revenue and profit month by month, with separate lines for 2023, 2024 and 2025, allowing direct year-over-year comparison of seasonal patterns and trend deviations.

## 2. Product & Pricing Performance

Analyses which product categories and individual products contribute most to revenue, profit and sales volume and evaluates how discounting affects profitability. Includes a **category revenue/profit bar chart**, a **top 10 products chart** combining units sold and revenue and a **discount-level profitability chart** showing how margins shift across different discount tiers. Two page-level KPIs highlight the top category by revenue and profit.

## 3. Market & Location Performance

Evaluates performance geographically across regions, stores and customer cities. A **map visual** plots each store sized by total revenue. A **clustered column chart** compares revenue and profit by store and region. An **AOV chart** shows average order value per location and a **customer city bar chart** identifies the top-contributing cities by revenue and profit.

> Note: The original dataset used fictional city names. A supplementary location table with real U.S. coordinates was created to enable the map visual.

## 4. Customer & Demand Behaviour

Examines when customers buy, how they pay, and which customers generate the most value. A **weekday activity chart** combines transaction count, unique customers and revenue by day of week. A **top 10 customers bar chart** ranks customers by a composite revenue + profit score, with an interactive toggle to switch to a detailed table view. A **stacked column chart** shows transaction counts by payment method per city and a **stacked area chart** tracks revenue by payment method over time.

## 5. Operations & Promotional Effectiveness

Split across two pages, this section analyses discount strategy and temporal demand patterns.

**Page 1 — Discount Overview:** Three KPI cards show Discounted Revenue, Non-Discounted Revenue and Discounted Revenue Share (%). A **donut chart** visualises the revenue split and a **dual-line chart** tracks both revenue streams month by month.

![Operations — Discounts](assets/dashboards/05_operations_discounts.png)

**Page 2 — Discount Performance & Demand Patterns:** A **scatter chart** plots each discount level by total quantity sold vs. profit margin (bubble size = revenue), revealing the volume-profitability trade-off. A **line and column chart** compares quantity and revenue across discount tiers. A **weekly demand chart** shows revenue and average order value by weekday and a **monthly area chart** reveals seasonal sales patterns.

## Interactive Features

### Map - Revenue by Location
Each page includes button-style year slicers for easy filtering. 
On the Market & Location page, changing the year also resizes the store bubbles on the map based on total revenue, making geographic performance shifts immediately visible.

### Category Filter
The Product & Pricing page includes a category slicer for Electronics, Fashion and Groceries. 
Selecting a category updates the KPI cards, the revenue/profit bar chart, the top products chart and the discount-level chart simultaneously.

### Customer Table Toggle
The Top 10 Customers visual on the Customer & Demand page includes an interactive toggle that switches between a bar chart view and a detailed table showing Customer ID, first name, tenure in years, total revenue and total profit.

## Semantic Model

Built as a **star schema** in Microsoft Fabric with the Transactions table as the fact table and four dimension tables: Customers, Products, Stores, and a custom Date dimension spanning 2020–2025.

**15 DAX measures** were developed, including:

| Measure | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `Total Revenue` | Core revenue metric: quantity × unit price × (1 - discount) |
| `Total Profit` | Revenue minus total cost of goods sold |
| `Profit Margin` | Profit as a percentage of revenue |
| `Average Order Value (AOV)` | Revenue ÷ total transactions |
| `Total Revenue YTD` | Cumulative revenue from start of year |
| `YoY Revenue %` | Year-over-year revenue growth percentage |
| `Top Customer Score` | Ranks customers by 50% revenue + 50% profit |
| `Top Product Score` | Ranks products by 50% quantity + 50% revenue |
| `Discounted Revenue` | Revenue from transactions with a discount applied |
| `Discounted Revenue Share (%)` | Discounted revenue as a share of total revenue |
| `IsTopCity` | Flags cities in the top 10 by revenue or profit |
